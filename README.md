# My Journey into Typescript

I will make a record of the things I will have learnt.  
This is to better understand **typescript**, when and where to use it.

### Notes

- **Typescript** is _strictly typed_ - meaning if a variable's type is set, you can only assign values of that type to it
  - This allows catching of errors earlier on
- It helps in the enforcing of set types

- to avoid having to copy type definitions all over we use an **inerface**

- does not change how you do things, just variable declarations & loops
  - in those cases, allow it to infer what the type is
